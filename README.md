# IHA-YOLO

Official PyTorch implementation of **IHA-YOLO**: Inter-Head Attention for Real-time Cell Detection and Counting.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the required packages, run the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n iha_yolo python=3.10
conda activate iha_yolo
pip install torch===2.3.0 torchvision torchaudio
pip install seaborn thop timm einops
cd ultralytics
pip install -e .
```

## Training

To train the IHA-YOLO model, use the following code snippet:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the model configuration and weights
model = YOLO("IHA-YOLO/ultralytics/cfg/models/iha-yolo/iha-yolom.yaml").load("yolov10m.pt")

# Start training
results = model.train(data="data.yaml", epochs=200)
```

## Testing

To evaluate the trained model, you can use the following code:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the model configuration and weights
model = YOLO("IHA-YOLO/ultralytics/cfg/models/iha-yolo/iha-yolom.yaml").load("yolov10m.pt")

# Validate the model
metrics = model.val()

# Print evaluation metrics
print(f"Mean Average Precision @ .5:.95 : {metrics.box.map}")
print(f"Mean Average Precision @ .50   : {metrics.box.map50}")
print(f"Mean Average Precision @ .70   : {metrics.box.map75}")
```

## Performance Comparison

*Speed (fps) vs.  Average mAP50,  averaged across five challenging cell detection datasets. Our IHA-YOLO (in \textcolor{red}{red}) achieves state-of-the-art Average mAP50 while operating at high speed. Additionally, detailed mAP comparisons at various IoU thresholds with the baseline YOLOv10 on BOrg, MoNuSAC, and CoNSeP show that our IHA-YOLO demonstrates excellent performance gains across diverse datasets and IoU thresholds, particularly at tighter IoU criteria, while operating at a similar speed. Inference speed for all methods is reported under fair settings, with a 640Ã—640 image resolution on a single RTX 4090 24GB GPU.*
